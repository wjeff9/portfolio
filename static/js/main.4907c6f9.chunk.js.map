I tried Open Sans along with Open Sans Condensed but the capital \"J\" letter really bothered me because it protruded out the bottom. Because my name has a \"J\" in it, this made the logo look awful. The other condensed fonts didn't fit the aesthetic I was going for. Thus, I changed my plan and ended up going for just a geometric font instead. Instead of having a condensed counter part, I would just use different weights along with capitalization to make it seem like two different fonts with synergy. The most popular geometric font on Google Fonts is Montserrat but I personally do not like the way the capital \"J\" and \"G\" look. Thus, I ended up finding a font called Poppins that has a perfectly circular capital G similar to Futura, which I am a fan of. */}\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default ProjMyWebsite;","import React from \"react\"\n\nfunction ProjSecurate(props) {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"proj-body\">\n            {/* <img src={Thumbnail} alt=\"a photo of me\" className=\"project-photo\" /> */}\n            <h1>Securate</h1>\n            {/* <h2>Overview</h2> */}\n            <p className=\"larticle\">\n                In an age dominated by the internet, it is important to prevent our personal information from falling into the wrong hands.

This question gives me a quantitative understanding of the participant's involvement with food. At first, I used the term “cooking” instead of “making food,” but I realized that some people might not associate the term “cooking” with actions such as baking cookies (baking) or preparing sushi (uncooked). When designing an online survey, I am especially clear with my wording because minute details can completely change a question’s meaning. Because it's online, participants are unable to clear up their misunderstandings because there are no researchers present to answer their questions.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                The second part asks for the participant's opinion on Foodie’s different features.

Thus, I had to ask the participant about features they would potentially use, assuming they were oblivious. Likewise, I was curious about features the participant did not care for.

Then, we asked participants to group the related cards, labelling different groups as they went. The groups and labels the participants created helped us determine the actual labels users would click on when navigating to each feature. \n            </p>\n            \n            <h1 className=\"title1\">Information Architecture</h1>\n\n            <p className=\"larticle\">\n                {/* Now that I had an understanding of the way different features were perceived by the users, I was comfortable with redesigning the app’s information architecture; I now knew which services should be quickly accessible from the home page and which services should be in more niche locations. */}\n                With research, we discovered valuable input on how to structure Foodie's information. With my survey, we would have understood which features to prioritize on the navigation bar. Additionally, with the card sort, we observed which labels others would have clicked on to navigate to each service.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <h2 className=\"title2\">Site Map</h2>\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                We started with a top-down approach, beginning with labels that would be accessible from the home page. My group estimated that the three most important features of Foodie were the recipe database, shop, and social media platform (we would have discovered this with the survey). Because these were the main features, navigation to these pages should be instantaneous. Thus, the first two labels we decided on were “Recipe Book” and “Shop,” with the social media platform being the home page.\n            </p>\n            <img src={RecipeIA} alt=\"information architecture for the 'recipe' label\" className=\"proj-photo\" />\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                I wanted to make the social media newsfeed our home page because I saw it as a bridge that connected the app’s other features. For example, when a user posts a photo of some fish tacos he made, he could link the recipe he used to make the tacos (from the recipe book) and the griddle he bought to fry the tacos (from the shope). Not only does this feature help users find related content (fixing an issue with the original app), it also seamlessly connects the rest of the app like an ecosystem.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                We decided that all the other services on Foodie could be grouped under a label called “Community” because they were not as important.\n            </p>\n            <img src={CommunityIA} alt=\"information architecture for the 'community' label\" className=\"proj-photo\" />\n            <p className=\"sarticle\">\n                This included less popular features like the forum, local event database and user database. Initially, I thought about about including the private messaging feature under here as well; however, messaging is heavily used in other social media apps so in the end, I decided to make it accessible from the home page.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                Last but not least, on the first layer of our information architecture, we included an “Account” label which includes the standard “Profile” and “Settings” pages. As a result, our first layer consisted of \"Recipe Book,\" \"Shop,\" \"Community,\" and \"Account.\"\n            </p>\n            <img src={AccountIA} alt=\"information architecture for the 'account' label\" className=\"proj-photo\" />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                A significant change I made to our information architecture was deciding to combine the “Video Tutorial” and “Recipe Book” sections. The old app had separate search pages for finding recipes and videos; however, because Foodie’s videos and recipes both serve a similar purpose of teaching the user how to cook certain dishes, this made the app unnecessarily complex. Instead, we decided to include videos on the same page as their corresponding recipes. If a video did not have a related recipe page, we could process the video into a written recipe with speech recognition. Additionally, this adds accessibility for deaf people who would prefer something written over audio instructions. \n                \n                {/* It also solves the problem of being unable to find related content; previously, the video and recipe for the same dish were not guaranteed to be linked together. */}\n            </p>\n            \n            <p className=\"article\"><br /></p>\n            <h2 className=\"title2\">Tree Test</h2>\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                Throughout the process, we conducted tree tests with our site map to confirm that navigation was as intuitive as possible.

First, I did not want to replicate Instagram’s liking mechanism, which is double tapping, because that would be stealing. Moreover, it would not flow well because unlike Instagram, tapping on a post in Foodie expands its contents. Instead, I increased the size of the like and comment buttons to make them easier to tap. I placed the buttons in a location where users would feel comfortable reaching them while operating a phone with one hand. Furthermore, upon hearing user feedback, there will be an option in the settings to switch the like and comment buttons to the left side of the screen for left-handed users. Similarly, I did not replicate Instagram’s private messaging icon, which is a paper plane, because before using Instagram, I do not think many people related paper planes with messages. Instead, I chose a mail icon to represent an inbox, which in Foodie’s context would mean private messages. I couldn’t use the speech bubble icon because it was already being used for comments.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n            Like I explained before, when a post is expanded, the user will be able to scroll through cards to explore related content and products mentioned in the post.

After noting down the players' pain points, I set out to redesign each puzzle.\n            </p>\n            <h1 className=\"title1\">Redesign</h1>\n            <h2 className=\"title2\">Puzzle 1: Before</h2>\n            <img src={Puzzle1B} alt=\"Mark Novo website template\" className=\"proj-photo\" />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                This is what the first puzzle previously looked like. The puzzle is solved by matching the correct gray star onto every gold star. The purple circles will then highlight certain letters that are used to form a password that unlocks the next puzzle.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                The original design was not super intuitive but in this context, it is actually not an issue. In a real escape room, the last thing your captor would do is give you clear instructions on how to escape. Not being absolutely clear makes the game more challenging and more rewarding to solve.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                The main problem with the first puzzle was immersion. The first puzzle was just thrown together with some text in a questionable font pairing on a default white background, which hurt to look at.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <h2 className=\"title2\">Puzzle 1: After</h2>\n            <img src={Puzzle1} alt=\"Mark Novo website template\" className=\"proj-photo\" />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                This is my Figma redesign of the first puzzle. In real life, escape rooms use unsuspecting objects such as paintings and clocks on a wall to give players clues. To simulate the feeling of being in a real escape room, I decided use a skeuomorphic (neumorphic) theme. I played with gradients and drop-shadows to give the environement a 3D effect. I'm aware that the modern feel of this theme does not give off a creepy vibe like most escape rooms, but our mentor felt that making the game intense/scary would take away from its educational aspect (which is debatable).\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                I transformed the cards with gray stars into post-it notes to emphasize that they were meant to be moved around. I might have been inspired by Miro after using it all quarter (see my usability testing notes). Next, I translated the gold stars into tacks and recolored the background tan to imitate a pin board. These represent where to place the post-it notes. The hardest item to redesign were the purple circles. Initially, I wanted to use highlighter marks, but in real life, they cannot transfer from the pin board onto the post-it notes. I settled on lasers, which shine over the pin board and the post-it notes so dragging the post-it notes around would interact realistically with the environment.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                By making the puzzle more immersive, I also unintentionally made it easier to solve, so to compensate, I altered the tacks and lasers to a similar size. With the previous version, players would often try to match the gray stars with the purple circles, so I tried to bring back this confusion with the similarly sized items.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"article\">\n                To be continued . . .\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default ProjEscape;","import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport { Route, Link, Switch, Redirect, HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport About from './About.js'\nimport Work from './Work.js'\nimport ScrollToTop from './ScrollToTop.js'\nimport ProjMyWebsite from './ProjMyWebsite'\nimport ProjSecurate from './ProjSecurate'\nimport ProjFoodie from './ProjFoodie'\nimport ProjEscape from './ProjEscape'\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  // TODO: Fix link iteraction (active link should be white)\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <HashRouter>\n        <ScrollToTop>\n          <nav>\n            <Link to=\"/about\" id=\"logo\">Jeffrey Wang</Link>\n            <div className=\"nav-row\">\n              <Link to=\"/about\" className=\"nav-col\">About</Link>\n              <Link to=\"/work\" className=\"nav-col\">Work</Link>\n            </div>\n          </nav>\n          <Switch>\n            <Redirect exact path=\"/\" to=\"/about\" />\n            <Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/work\" component={Work} />\n            <Route path=\"/work/foodie\" component={ProjFoodie} />\n            <Route path=\"/work/securate\" component={ProjSecurate} />\n            <Route path=\"/work/this+website\" component={ProjMyWebsite} />\n            <Route path=\"/work/escape+room\" component={ProjEscape} />\n\n          </Switch>\n        </ScrollToTop>\n      </HashRouter>\n      <footer>\n        <p id=\"contact\">Contact</p>\n        <br />\n        <a className=\"contact-info\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-wang-327b0915b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>\n        <br />\n        <a className=\"contact-info\" href=\"mailto:jeffwhy99@gmail.com\">Email</a>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <p>© 2021 Jeffrey Wang</p>\n      </footer>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
